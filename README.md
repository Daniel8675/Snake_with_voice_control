# How to play?

* [Click Here](https://github.com/Daniel8675/Snake_with_voice_control/releases)
* From assets download "game.zip"
* Extract the file to a folder
* Click on the "main.exe" and enjoy 😃
* It may take some time for the game to start up, no worries

# Things to do

* Voice control improvement. Voice control is too dependent on microphone settings, giving the impression that the program is not working.
* Getting rid of global values!
* Change from multithreading to multiprocessing to have better control over the prediction process shutdown.
